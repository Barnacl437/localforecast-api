# localforecast-api
a json file that can speak and provide independent local weather data (hanoi, vietnam). a demo-esque for anyone learning js (data fetch and display).

data will be updated in range of one hour to 7 days or more.

*i am not guaranteed for whether the weather data used here is accurate or completely independent; i may look up on google for different reports, or use my home thermometer to measure, or to guess using my divinity mind.*
